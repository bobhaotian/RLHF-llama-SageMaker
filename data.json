        "Answer": "It's not entirely clear what is meant by \\sqrt[m]{x^m}.  This notation is unusual because if the intent is that \\sqrt[m]{x^m} = |x|, presumably, the question should have simply used the absolute value notation.  If the intent is that \\sqrt[m]{x^m} = x, again, the question should have been written that way.\n\nIf we assume the former--i.e. the intent is \\sqrt[m]{x^m} = |x|--then we may write for all real x\n\\frac{x^2 + 7|x| + 6}{|x| + 1} = \\frac{|x|^2 + 7|x| + 6}{|x| + 1} = \\frac{(|x| + 1)(|x| + 6)}{|x| + 1} = |x| + 6.

        "Answer": "No, your argument is not correct. The issue of 1^\\infty being an indeterminate form has nothing to do with integer exponents per se; one is instead interested in real valued exponents approaching \\infty. It also has nothing to do with changing the base to -1, which on the infinitesmal scale of limits is far, far away from 1; one is instead interested in real valued bases approaching 1.\n\nI suggest simply reading the accepted answer of the post you linked to. In brief summary, what matters are the values of the expression b^x as one lets the base b approach 1 and the exponent x approach \\infty: the limiting value is not well defined.

I sort of understand the first one, but the other two I don't.\n\nThank you",
        "Answer": "Your first and second cases are equivalent. You need to understand complex numbers to be able to see that. The complex numbers, written C\\mathbb{C} are of the form x+iyx+iy where xx and yy are real numbers that you already know and ii is a special number with i2=−1i^2 = -1. Usually, we have i=√−1i = \\sqrt{-1}. To see that the second case is the same as the first, notice that:\n\n2x+3(x−1)(x2+4)≡Ax−1+Bx−2i+Cx+2i\\frac{2x+3}{(x-1)(x^2+4)} \\equiv \\frac{A}{x-1}+\\frac{B}{x-2i}+\\frac{C}{x+2i}\n\nwhere A=1A=1, B=−12−i14B=-\\frac{1}{2}-i\\frac{1}{4} and C=−12+i14C=-\\frac{1}{2}+i\\frac{1}{4}. The only reason you are taught the second form is that you don't know about x±2ix\\pm 2i and they recombine them:\n\nBx−2i+Cx+2i≡1−xx2+4\\frac{B}{x-2i} + \\frac{C}{x+2i} \\equiv \\frac{1-x}{x^2+4}\n\nThe third case isn't quite the same. But notice that the denominator is a cubic. When you multiply it out, you'll have an x3x^3 and lower powers. We couldn't get away with just two fraction because\n\nAx−a+Bx−b≡A(x−b)+B(x−a)(x−a)(x−b)\\frac{A}{x-a}+\\frac{B}{x-b} \\equiv \\frac{A(x-b)+B(x-a)}{(x-a)(x-b)}\n\nand this only has a quadratic expression as the denominator."

        "Question": "Let f(x) be a parabola and f'(x) its derivative.\nGiven are the known points (p, q) and (r, s):\nq = f(p) and s = f(r).\n\nAlso given are the values of the desired derivatives\nin p and r. Lets say t and u.\n\nIn the ideal case, we want to find an f such that\nf'(p) = t and f'(r) = u. However, that might not be possible\nif no such quadratic polynomial exists for f.\n\nHow to find a parabola f(x) such that f(p) = q, f(r) = s\nand f'(p) and f'(r) are such that the error in both is\nequal?\n\nOne way to define this error is by looking at the\nangle the tangents make; aka a vertical line deviates the same amount from y=x as a horizontal line; even though the derivatives are infinity, 1 and 0 respectively. But I'm happy with other definitions as well if that makes the equations easier. For example, just looking at the difference between the values of the derivatives: |f'(r) - u| = |f'(p) - u|.\n\nEDIT:\n\nMy attempt was as follows:\n\nLet f(x) = a x^2 + b x + c, with derivative f'(x) = 2a x + b.\n\nThis gives, with regard to the derivative constraints:\n\n2p a + b = t\\\\\n2r a + b = u\n\nor\n\n\\begin{bmatrix}\n2p & 1 \\\\\n2r & 1\n\\end{bmatrix}\n\\begin{bmatrix}\na \\\\\nb\n\\end{bmatrix} =\n\\begin{bmatrix}\nt \\\\\nu\n\\end{bmatrix}\n\nFor which we can solve\n\n\\begin{bmatrix}\na \\\\\nb\n\\end{bmatrix} =\n\\frac{1}{2(p-r)}\n\\begin{bmatrix}\nt - u \\\\\n2pu - 2rt\n\\end{bmatrix}\n\nNow we can calculate\n\nf(p) - f(r) = a (p^2 - r^2) + b (p - r)\n\nRealizing that this difference really should have been q - s, the function can be corrected by adding a linear function to it. In other words, adjusting b by adding \\frac{q - s - (a (p^2 - r^2) + b (p - r))}{p - r} to it.\n\nThis then leads to:\n\na = \\frac{t - u}{2(p - r)} \\\\\nb = \\frac{pu−rt}{p - r} + \\frac{q - s - (\\frac{t - u}{2(p - r)} (p^2 - r^2) + \\frac{pu−rt}{p - r} (p - r))}{p - r} =\n\\frac{pu−rt+q-s+\\frac{(u-t)(p+r)}{2}+rt-pu}{p - r}=\n\\frac{2q-2s+(u-t)(p+r)}{2(p-r)}\n\nFrom which c trivially follows.\n\nStrangely enough this is not equal to what xpaul did get...\n\nEdit2\n\nI was forced to reformulate my question, which is now posted here: Fitting a parabola through two points in which the derivatives are known with the aim of finding a minimum.",
        "Answer": "A parabolic function has the equation\n\nf(x) = a x^2 + b x + c\n\nIt is fully determined by three parameters which are a,b,c.\n\nThe given conditions in the problem lead to the fully overdetermined linear system in a,b,c:\n\na p^2 + b p + c = q\n\na r^2 + b r + c = s\n\n2 a p + b = t\n\n2 a r + b = u\n\nSince you want the first two equations to be satisfied by (a,b,c), then you have to solve the smaller underdetermined system\n\na p^2 + b p + c = q\n\na r^2 + b r + c = s\n\nThis is a rank 2 system, and its solution will be of the form\n\n[a,b,c]^T = X_0 + \\lambda X_1\n\nwhere X_0, X_1 are known 3-vectors, and \\lambda is a free parameter, \\lambda \\in \\mathbb{R}.\n\nNow we want the error in f'(p) and f'(r) to be equal, i.e. we want\n\n2 a p + b - t = 2 a r + b - u\n\nThis simplifies to\n\n2 a (p - q) = t - u\n\nSince a linearly depends on X_{01} and X_{11} , then this condition can always be satisfied.\n\nCan you take it from here?"

        "Answer": "It looks like you are trying to state the chain rule, one of the fundamental laws of calculus, which relates total d and partial \\partial derivatives. For a function f(x_1,x_2,...,x_n)\n\ndf=\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial x_1}dx_1 + \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial x_2}dx_2+...+\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial x_n}dx_n\n\nThis can be understood heuristically as follows: let us say that f(x,y)\nis the height f of a surface at any coordinate point (x,y).  As an example, let us try to find the change in vertical height f between two points on this oddly sloped table.\n\nIt is sloped in both the x and y directions shown, and those slopes are different, but they are constant in each direction.\n\nGoing from points f_0 to f_1, if we travel first a distance dy, the change in height over that distance is f_y~dy, where f_y is the slope in the y direction.  We then move a distance dx in the x direction, with our height changing by a further  f_x~dx, where f_x is the slope in the x direction.  (Note, red dotted lines are lines of constant height, parallel to the floor).\n\nThe total height change from f_0 to f_1 is the sum of the solid red lines:\n\ndf=f_x~dx + f_y~dy\n\nAnd the slopes f_x and f_y are nothing but the partial derivatives \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial x} and \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial y}.\n\nTherefore:\n\ndf=\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial x}dx + \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial y}dy\n\nwhich is the chain rule.  This can be extended to any number of independent (i.e. orthogonal) variables.\n\nBecause we are considering small (infinitesimal) changes, a surface or function of arbitrary overall shape will take the form of a plane like the table shown, with a constant linear slope in the direction of each variable – in the same way that in \\rm 1D calculus, any smooth curve becomes a straight line if you zoom in to an infinitesimal distance.  So this analysis applies to any smooth surface or function (i.e. with no holes or other exotic features).\n\nSIDE NOTE: In general relativity or curved spaces in general (per the original question), the chain rule and the product rule are the same, but when differentiating vectors you have to account for both the vector magnitude and the unit vector itself changing with location, i.e.\n\n\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x_i}\\vec{\\bf v}~=~\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x_i}\\left(v_j\\bf{\\vec{e}_j}\\right)~=~\\frac{\\partial v_j}{\\partial x_i}\\boldsymbol{\\vec{e}_j}+v_j\\frac{\\partial  \\boldsymbol{\\vec{e}_j}}{\\partial x_i}"

        "Answer": "It's not entirely clear what is meant by \\sqrt[m]{x^m}.  This notation is unusual because if the intent is that \\sqrt[m]{x^m} = |x|, presumably, the question should have simply used the absolute value notation.  If the intent is that \\sqrt[m]{x^m} = x, again, the question should have been written that way.\n\nIf we assume the former--i.e. the intent is \\sqrt[m]{x^m} = |x|--then we may write for all real x\n\\frac{x^2 + 7|x| + 6}{|x| + 1} = \\frac{|x|^2 + 7|x| + 6}{|x| + 1} = \\frac{(|x| + 1)(|x| + 6)}{|x| + 1} = |x| + 6.  Cancellation is allowed because |x| + 1 > 0.\nThen integration proceeds as usual:\n\\int |x| + 6 \\, dx = \\frac{x|x|}{2} + 6x + C = x\\left(\\frac{|x|}{2} + 6 \\right) + C."

I've attempted a substitution to simplify the expression, but I'm not sure how to proceed further.

        "Question": "While studying indeterminate forms I like many others had used this post to understand why 1^\\infty is indeterminate. Today I thought of a new and perhaps simpler argument to explain why this is so but I couldn't find it among the answers in the post.\nMy argument is that we can write 1^x = (-1)^{2.x}\nNow if x = \\infty, then 1^\\infty = (-1)^{\\infty},\nWhich is only true if we can say infinity is even or odd which we can't say.\nSo, am I correct, or I have made some mistakes in my assumptions.",
        "Answer": "No, your argument is not correct. The issue of 1^\\infty being an indeterminate form has nothing to do with integer exponents per se; one is instead interested in real valued exponents approaching \\infty. It also has nothing to do with changing the base to -1, which on the infinitesmal scale of limits is far, far away from 1; one is instead interested in real valued bases approaching 1.\n\nI suggest simply reading the accepted answer of the post you linked to. In brief summary, what matters are the values of the expression b^x as one lets the base b approach 1 and the exponent x approach \\infty: the limiting value is not well defined. That's what makes the expression 1^\\infty an indeterminate form."
