In other words, for any two elements x,y in X, there exists a g in G such that g(x)=y. The following is a theorem that is very useful in determining whether a representation is a permutation representation.\\nTheorem: Let G be a group acting on a set X. Then the following are equivalent:\\n1. The action of G on X is transitive.\\n2. The stabilizer of any element in X is a conjugacy class of G.\\n3. The stabilizer of any element in X is a maximal subgroup of G.\\n4. The stabilizer of any element in X is a normal subgroup of G.\\n5. The action of G on X is a permutation representation.\\nProof: 1. implies 2. Let x be an element in X. Then for any y in X, there exists a g in G such that g(x)='}\n"
